        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                 Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                 <li>Combine sugar, soy sauce, cider vinegar, cornstarch, cold water, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small saucepan over low heat. 
                    Simmer, stirring frequently, until teriyaki sauce thickens and bubbles, 3 to 5 minutes.
                     Remove from the heat.</li>
                     <li>Place chicken thighs in the prepared baking dish. 
                        Brush both sides of each thigh with the sauce. 
                        Reserve any extra sauce for basting.</li>

                        <li>Flip chicken and brush with sauce. 
                            Continue to bake, basting with remaining sauce every 10 minutes, until no longer pink and juices run clear, 20 to 30 more minutes.</li>
